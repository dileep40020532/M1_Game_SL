Snakes and ladders, known originally as Moksha Patam, is an ancient Indian board game for two or more players regarded today as a worldwide classic.[1] It is played on a game board with numbered, gridded squares. A number of "ladders" and "snakes" are pictured on the board, each connecting two specific board squares. The object of the game is to navigate one's game piece, according to die rolls, from the start (bottom square) to the finish (top square), helped by climbing ladders but hindered by falling down snakes.

## Constraints and Rules:-
1.The game will begin with any dice value.

2.The board will have 100 cells numbered from 1 to 100.

3.Each player has a piece which is initially kept outside the board (i.e., at position 0).

4.If a 6(six) is appeared then a chance is awarded to that player.

5.Whenever a piece ends up at a position with the head of the snake, the piece should go down to the position of that snake tale.

6.Each ladder will have its start position at some number and end position at a larger number.

7.Snakes:-  98 to 25, 64 to 48, 20 to 7.
